ABOUT THE PROJECT :
This is a twitter-bot that reads the recent tweets from the specified users. It reads the latest tweets once in 60 seconds. So have the number of users under 5 or 6 to get maximum benefit.
This is my first Twitter project. Simple but useful.

HOW TO USE :
Install the required dependencies
1. python-simplejson
2. python-httplib2

They are just Kbs in size.

Find the four values from your Twitter Account and replace them in the program

AGENT_TOKEN_SECRET

Then open up terminal.

In a few seconds you must be able to listen to the latest tweets from your favourite tweeps.
